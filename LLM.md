            'multimodal': load_expert('phi4'),
            'spatial': load_expert('proprietary_3d')
        }
        self.routing_policy = RoutingPolicy(config)
        self.spatial_context = SpatialContextManager()
        
    def route(self, inputs, context=None, resources=None):
        # Analyze input modalities and task requirements
        task_embedding = self.classify_task(inputs)
        
        # Determine optimal expert allocation based on task and resources
        routing_plan = self.routing_policy.plan(
            task_embedding,
            context=context,
            available_resources=resources
        )
        
        # Initialize spatial context if relevant
        if routing_plan.requires_spatial:
            self.spatial_context.initialize(inputs)
        
        # Execute routing plan through selected experts
        outputs = self.execute_plan(inputs, routing_plan)
        
        # Update spatial context with new information
        if routing_plan.requires_spatial:
